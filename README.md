# Desenvolve oBoticario

## Overview
Welcome to the repository for my learning journey in the "Desenvolve" program by oBotic√°rio. This repository serves as a centralized space to organize and document my notes, projects, and insights throughout the course. The program, provided by Alura, unfolds weekly, and this documentation will help keep track of my progress and achievements.

## How to Navigate
- Weekly Notes: Find detailed notes for each week's lessons in the respective folders.

Let's embark on this learning journey together! üåêüíª‚ú®
